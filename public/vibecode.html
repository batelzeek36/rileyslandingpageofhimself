                <h2>The Company</h2>
                <p>VibeCode is an AI-powered platform co-founded by Riley Brown that revolutionizes app development by making it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background. The platform embodies the concept of "Vibe Coding" — using AI to create applications without traditional programming knowledge.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Users simply submit text prompts describing the app they want to build — from rental services to photo sharing platforms. VibeCode then generates a complete mobile application in as little as 20 minutes. The platform works similarly to how Canva democratized design or CapCut simplified video editing.</p>

                <div class="featured">
                    <h3>Examples of Apps Built</h3>
                    <p>• Rental service applications<br>• Photo sharing platforms<br>• Video games and interactive experiences<br>• Full-stack web applications with databases<br>• Voice-enabled applications<br>• Music players and media apps</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Vision</h2>
                <p>Riley hopes VibeCode inspires creators to launch apps for their audiences by making the development process more accessible. The platform aims to provide that crucial "aha" moment that gets people excited about technology and app development without the traditional barriers.</p>

                <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
                <p>VibeCode leverages cutting-edge AI tools and frameworks, including integration with Cursor, Claude, OpenAI, and other modern AI development platforms. The platform can generate applications with features like:</p>
                
                <p>• Database integration and authentication<br>• Google sign-in capabilities<br>• Voice-to-text processing<br>• Cloud hosting and deployment<br>• Real-time data processing</p>

                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p>VibeCode is currently in beta, with Riley Brown actively demonstrating its capabilities through comprehensive tutorials and real-world app builds. The platform represents the future of no-code/low-code development, powered by artificial intelligence.</p>
